Hey there people,

I’m a current MGEM student with a strong interest in GIS and spatial analysis. I work regularly with Python and R, and I’m experienced in QGIS and ArcGIS Pro. My projects have focused on LiDAR processing, urban land and canopy analysis, and using geospatial data to understand environmental patterns. I enjoy turning spatial data into clear maps and useful insights.
